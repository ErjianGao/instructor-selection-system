## Background

When students are seniors, they need to choose their graduate design tutor to help them complete their graduate design. And the teachers have their rights to determine which students can choose them as tutor. So they can set requirements, and only the students who meet all of the requirements the teacher set can they choose the teacher as their graduate design tutor. And of course, different teachers have different requirements and the maximum of students they can help. 

So the graduate design tutor selection tool is aiming to help students and tutors choose each other conveniently. Further more, this tool will first be tried to be used by Bo Wang, Lecturer in Software Engineering, Northeast Forestry University:school: and his students major in software engineering. 

## Features

### For teachers

- Set their requirements beforehand on the website. 
- Import students information form Excel files. 

### For students

- Submit their information, like GPAs, and directions of graduate design to check whether they can choose this teacher.
